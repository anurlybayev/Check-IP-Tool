I needed a script that would check my Dynamic ISP IP and if it has changed send me an e-mail.

The original idea was taken from:
http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=2004102508055243

The service I am using to check my IP: http://checkip.dyndns.org

Dependencies:
Email::Send
Email::Send::Gmail
Email::Simple::Creator
Crypt::Lite;

Release notes:
Version 0.2
Added simple encryption so that the passwords you provide are not in plain text.
You have to run configure.pl once and then you can set your cron to run check_ip.pl.
Scripts must have permission to write to local dir.
